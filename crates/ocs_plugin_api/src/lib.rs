//! # Open CAD Studio plugin API
//!
//! The stable, semver-versioned contract an add-on package targets instead of
//! the `OpenCADStudio` binary internals. It is intentionally **dependency
//! free** (no `iced`, no `opencadcodec`) so engine crates and external tooling can
//! depend on it cheaply.
//!
//! Two pieces live here:
//!
//! - [`manifest`] — plugin identity ([`PluginManifest`]) and the host ABI
//!   version handshake ([`ApiVersion`]).
//! - [`ribbon`] — the [`CadModule`] trait and the plain-data ribbon types
//!   ([`RibbonGroup`], [`ToolDef`], …) a plugin uses to describe its tab.
//!
//! The runtime host surface a plugin uses at *dispatch* time (document access,
//! command line, undo) is `opencadcodec`-typed and therefore lives in the `host`
//! feature; it re-exports `opencadcodec` so plugins do not need to depend on it
//! directly and risk an ABI mismatch from a different version.
//!
//! For binary compatibility, the host and every plugin must resolve the same
//! `opencadcodec` source. The host does this via a `[patch.crates-io]` entry in
//! `Cargo.toml`; out-of-tree plugins should copy that exact patch.
//!
//! For internal architecture (process model, wire protocols, versioning policy,
//! failure modes), see `ARCHITECTURE.md` in the crate root. The modules enabled
//! by the `host` feature are:
//!
//! - `host` — plugin/runtime traits and notification types.
//! - `host_v4` — per-tab shared-memory snapshot manager.
//! - `ipc` — transport, V2/V3 protocol, and V4 multiplexed protocol.
//! - `process` — `PluginProcess` and `PluginManager`.
//! - `runner` — child-process runner entry point.
//! - `shm` — shared-memory document views.

// Layer translation — map this drawing's layers onto a set taken from another
// drawing, then move everything across.
//
// Drawings arrive from outside with someone else's layer names. Translating
// them is three separate jobs that the command, the dialog and the saved
// mappings all share: reading a target set out of another file, deciding which
// source layer becomes which target, and performing the move. Only the third
// touches the drawing, and it is the same move LAYMRG makes for a single pair,
// so both go through `merge_layer`. (#624)

// BEDIT — block editor as a dedicated "space" tab (issue #261).
//
// Workflow:
//   1. BEDIT: user picks an INSERT (or has one pre-selected).
//   2. A block-editor space opens: rendering, picking and new geometry are
//      scoped to the block's record, so ONLY the block's own (block-local)
//      entities are drawn — no INSERT transform, they show exactly as stored.
//   3. The user edits them with normal commands. Because they ARE the block
//      definition's entities, edits are live.
//   4. Save Block (BEDIT_SAVE): keep the edits and leave the block space.
//      Discard (BEDIT_DISCARD): restore the block to its on-entry snapshot.
//
// Unlike REFEDIT (which copies entities into model space with the INSERT
// transform and inverse-transforms them back on save), a BEDIT space edits the
// block record in place, so there is no copy-back and no transform — the space
// render filter (`current_layout_block_handle`) already draws only the block.

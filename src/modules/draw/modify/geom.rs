//! Adapters between the editing commands and `opencadkernel`'s plane geometry.
//!
//! The kernel takes points as `[f64; 2]` and hands tessellation back as
//! `[f64; 3]`. The commands here grew up passing loose `x, y` scalars and
//! feeding [`WireModel::points`](crate::scene::model::wire_model::WireModel),
//! which is `[f32; 3]`. These wrappers absorb that difference in one place so
//! the maths itself lives once, in the kernel.
//!
//! Narrowing to `f32` happens here rather than in the kernel deliberately:
//! preview wires leave `points_low` empty, so they accept the loss, while the
//! resident render path splits the `f64` into a high/low pair instead. Only a
//! caller knows which of the two it is.

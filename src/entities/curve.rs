//! An entity's geometry as a kernel curve.
//!
//! One converter, so that what is drawn, what is snapped to and what is
//! trimmed all read the same definition. Before this each of those grew its
//! own per-type match, and the three drifted: an arc's tessellation, its snap
//! points and its trim parameters were computed by different code from the
//! same fields.
//!
//! # The plane
//!
//! A [`Curve`] is two-dimensional; a drawing's curve lives on a plane in
//! space. The two together are a [`PlanarCurve`], and the plane comes from
//! the entity's **OCS** — its extrusion normal, run through the DXF
//! arbitrary-axis algorithm in [`ocs_axes`]. Not from the UCS: the UCS is the
//! working plane a user drew in, and an entity does not remember it. Draw a
//! circle in a UCS turned 30° about Z and the stored normal is still +Z, so
//! the frame this builds is the world one — which is exactly right, because
//! that is where the circle's stored coordinates are read.
//!
//! Entities that store WCS coordinates rather than OCS ones (LINE, ELLIPSE,
//! SPLINE, RAY, XLINE) still get a plane, derived from the geometry itself.
//! Where they turn out not to be planar at all, the answer is `None` rather
//! than a silent projection onto XY, which would move the geometry.
//!
//! # What is deliberately absent
//!
//! Text, hatch, dimensions, meshes, solids, images and blocks are not
//! curves. They keep their own paths and this returns `None` for them, which
//! is what lets a caller ask about any entity without checking first.

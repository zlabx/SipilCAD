# Open CAD Studio — Plugin Architecture

**Status:** Accepted
**Author:** Open CAD Studio contributors
**Date:** June 2026

This document is the **authoritative spec** for how add-on packages integrate
with Open CAD Studio. The model follows [QGIS](https://plugins.qgis.org/)-style
extensibility: a small metadata file, a single entry point, an optional separate
engine crate, and user-installable packages from a curated index.

> Plugins are **out-of-process dynamic libraries** (`cdylib`). The host loads
> first-party packages from its application resources and third-party packages
> from the user plugins folder. Both use the generic runtime
> (`src/plugin/`, `src/app/plugin_host.rs`) and the stable contract crate
> (`crates/ocs_plugin_api`). A user package with the same id explicitly
> overrides a bundled package.

---

## Design goals

| Goal | Rationale |
|------|-----------|
| **One package, one entry point** | Manifest, ribbon tab and commands ship together in the plugin crate; no edits to the host. |
| **Stable contract** | Authors target the semver-versioned `ocs_plugin_api` crate, not `OpenCADStudio` internals. |
| **Out-of-tree by default** | Third-party plugins remain independent; selected first-party plugins may build and ship with OCS. |
| **DWG round-trip** | Domain data lives on entities as XDATA, not in an opaque side database. |
| **Engine reuse** | A headless `std`-only engine crate can run in WASM/CLI without the CAD host. |

## Non-goals

- Signature verification (installing a plugin runs native code; the user trusts
  the repos they install from). Process isolation limits the blast radius of a
  buggy or malicious plugin, but it is not a security sandbox.
- Cross-toolchain binary compatibility — see [Compatibility](#compatibility--abi).
- Sandboxed scripting (Python/Lua); replacing the `opencadcodec` entity model.

## Three layers

```

└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

| Layer | Lives in | May depend on |
|-------|----------|---------------|
| **A — Host** | this repo: `src/`, `crates/ocs_plugin_api` runtime | everything |
| **B — Plugin** | a separate repo (cdylib), spawned by the host in runner mode | `ocs_plugin_api` + optional engine |
| **C — Engine** | the plugin's own crate or crates.io | `std` only (WASM/CLI-capable) |

**Hard rules**

1. The host (`src/plugin/`) imports no plugin code — it only knows the contract.
2. Engine crates import neither `iced`, `opencadcodec`, nor `OpenCADStudio`.
3. A plugin never edits host source; it runs entirely from its own crate.

---

## The contract crate — `ocs_plugin_api`

[`crates/ocs_plugin_api`](../crates/ocs_plugin_api) is the semver-versioned API a
plugin compiles against. Two tiers:

- **Dependency-free core** (default): `PluginManifest` / `ApiVersion` and the
  ribbon vocabulary — `CadModule`, `ToolDef`, `RibbonGroup`, `RibbonItem`,
  `IconKind`, `ModuleEvent`, `StyleKey`. Engine crates and tooling depend on this
  cheaply.
- **`host` feature** (pulls `opencadcodec`): the runtime surface — the `HostApi`
  trait, the `BuiltinPlugin` entry-point trait, the `export_plugin!` macro, and
  the out-of-process plugin runtime (`PluginProcess`, `runner`).

A plugin enables the `host` feature.

### Build-time ABI metadata

For API v4 and later the host records two pieces of build-time metadata that
affect whether a prebuilt plugin can safely be loaded:

- `acadrust_source` — the exact git source of the `opencadcodec` crate the host was
  built against.
- `rustc_version` — the output of `rustc --version` for the compiler that built
  the host.

A plugin's `plugin.toml` declares the same values under `[opencad]`. For API v4
and later, `rustc_version` is required and the host refuses to load the plugin
unless it matches exactly — omitting it is treated as a mismatch, not skipped.
This turns the current silent runner crash into a one-line diagnosis such as:

```
Plugin built with rustc 1.96.0, host requires 1.98.0 - rebuild required
```

`acadrust_source` is also required for API v4 and later. Missing, empty, or
mismatched metadata makes the package incompatible.

### `PluginManifest`

```rust
pub struct PluginManifest {
    pub id: &'static str,              // reverse-DNS: "opencad.example"
    pub name: &'static str,
    pub version: &'static str,
    pub description: &'static str,
    pub api_version: ApiVersion,       // host ABI major; must match the host
    pub ribbon_order: i32,             // sort key among add-on tabs
    pub xdata_apps: &'static [&'static str],
    pub command_prefixes: &'static [&'static str],
}
```

### `BuiltinPlugin` — the entry point

```rust
pub trait BuiltinPlugin: Send + Sync {
    fn manifest(&self) -> &'static PluginManifest;
    fn ribbon(&self) -> Box<dyn CadModule>;            // the ribbon tab
    fn dispatch(&self, host: &mut dyn HostApi, cmd: &str) -> bool;
    fn on_load(&mut self, host: &mut dyn HostApi) {}
}
```

### `HostApi` — the plugin-facing runtime surface

`dispatch` receives `&mut dyn HostApi`, so a plugin never touches the host's
concrete types:

| Category | Methods |
|----------|---------|
| Document | `document()` / `document_mut()` return a **local cached copy** of the document (API v3); the first access in a dispatch clones the full `CadDocument` over IPC. Use `add_entity()` / `write_record()` for host-visible mutations. `add_entity()`, `bump_geometry()` |
| XDATA | `read_record(handle, app)`, `write_record(handle, record)`, `remove_record(handle, app)` — keyed by entity handle; `write_record` registers the APPID so data round-trips through DWG/DXF |
| Tab state | object-safe `plugin_state_any*` helpers exist for in-process use; out-of-process plugins should keep state inside the plugin crate because `dyn Any` is not serializable |
| Command line | `push_info`, `push_output`, `push_error` |
| Undo / dirty | `push_undo`, `set_dirty` |
| Tab | `tab_index()` |
| Document identity (V5) | `document_path(tab_id)` returns the saved path for a document tab. |
| Notifications (V4) | `on_notification` receives `HostNotification::SelectionChangedV4 { tab_id, handles }` when the active tab's selection changes, plus `DocumentChangedV4` / `DocumentTabClosed`. |

### `export_plugin!` — the C-ABI export

```rust
ocs_plugin_api::export_plugin!(MyPlugin);
```

emits the two symbols the loader looks for:

- `ocs_plugin_api_version() -> u32` — checked **first**, so an API-incompatible
  build never runs its code.
- `ocs_plugin_register() -> *mut Box<dyn BuiltinPlugin>` — constructs the plugin
  and hands ownership to the host.

---

## Writing a plugin

A plugin is a standalone crate that builds a `cdylib`:

```toml
# Cargo.toml
[lib]
crate-type = ["cdylib"]

[dependencies]
ocs_plugin_api = { git = "https://github.com/HakanSeven12/OpenCADStudio", features = ["host"] }

# Match the host's opencadcodec so the loaded library is binary-compatible.
[patch.crates-io]
opencadcodec = { git = "https://github.com/HakanSeven12/opencadcodec", branch = "main" }
```

Your release build must also use the same `rustc` as the host. Record it in
`plugin.toml` (see below) and pin the toolchain in your CI matrix so every
published asset matches the host's compiler.

```rust
// src/lib.rs
use ocs_plugin_api::host::{BuiltinPlugin, HostApi};
use ocs_plugin_api::manifest::{ApiVersion, PluginManifest};
use ocs_plugin_api::ribbon::{CadModule, IconKind, ModuleEvent, RibbonGroup, RibbonItem, ToolDef};

static MANIFEST: PluginManifest = PluginManifest {
    id: "opencad.example", name: "Example Plugin", version: "0.1.0",
    description: "…", api_version: ApiVersion::CURRENT,
    ribbon_order: 50, xdata_apps: &[], command_prefixes: &["EX_"],
};

struct ExampleModule;
impl CadModule for ExampleModule {
    fn id(&self) -> &'static str { "example" }
    fn title(&self) -> &'static str { "Example" }
    // Returns a slice, not an owned Vec — build once into a static and hand
    // back a reference, rather than rebuilding (and dropping) it every call.
    fn ribbon_groups(&self) -> &[RibbonGroup] {
        static GROUPS: std::sync::OnceLock<Vec<RibbonGroup>> = std::sync::OnceLock::new();
        GROUPS.get_or_init(|| vec![RibbonGroup { title: "Demo", tools: vec![RibbonItem::LargeTool(ToolDef {
            id: "EX_HELLO", label: "Hello", icon: IconKind::Glyph("◆"),
            event: ModuleEvent::Command("EX_HELLO".to_string()),
        })]}]})
    }
}

struct ExamplePlugin;
impl BuiltinPlugin for ExamplePlugin {
    fn manifest(&self) -> &'static PluginManifest { &MANIFEST }
    fn ribbon(&self) -> Box<dyn CadModule> { Box::new(ExampleModule) }
    fn dispatch(&self, host: &mut dyn HostApi, cmd: &str) -> bool {
        match cmd { "EX_HELLO" => { host.push_info("Hello"); true } _ => false }
    }
}

ocs_plugin_api::export_plugin!(ExamplePlugin);
```

```toml
# plugin.toml — shipped beside the binary; values mirror MANIFEST
[plugin]
id = "opencad.example"
name = "Example Plugin"
version = "0.1.0"
description = "…"

[opencad]
api_version = 5
ribbon_order = 50
command_prefixes = ["EX_"]
xdata_apps = []
# Both are filled at release-build time; see the CI step below.
rustc_version = "rustc 1.98.0 (hash date)"
acadrust_source = "git+https://github.com/HakanSeven12/opencadcodec.git?rev=<short>#<full-40-char-commit>"
```

The full, buildable scaffold is in [`docs/plugin-template/`](plugin-template);
the live reference is the
[`opencad-example-plugin`](https://github.com/HakanSeven12/opencad-example-plugin)
repository.

### Commands

A plugin owns its `command_prefixes` (e.g. `EX_`). The host's command router
calls `try_dispatch` first; a returning `true` consumes the command. A plugin
tool fires `ModuleEvent::Command("EX_FOO")`, which round-trips to
`dispatch(host, "EX_FOO")`.

`ModuleEvent::PluginFileDialog { command, title, filter_name, extensions }` lets a
tool request a native file picker; on selection the host dispatches
`"<command> <path>"` back with the path's original case preserved.

A leading `>` or the persistent literal-input toggle preserves both spaces
and case. Automation and `ModuleEvent::PluginFileDialog` already preserve
case without this prefix.

### Interactive (click-to-place) commands

For tools that collect points — placing a structure, drawing a pipe — call
`host.start_interactive(Box::new(my_cmd))` from `dispatch`, where `my_cmd`
implements `ocs_plugin_api::host::InteractiveCommand`:

```rust
fn on_point(&mut self, pt: [f64; 3]) -> CommandStep {
    // … return NeedPoint, Commit(entity), CommitAndEnd(entity), Done, or Cancel
}
```

The host drives it through its normal point-collection flow, so the **same**
command works by clicking in the viewport and by feeding coordinates over the
`--serve` automation API (`run "MY_CMD 0,0 10,10"`). This is what bumped the
API to **v2** — the added `HostApi` method changes the contract's vtable, so v1
binaries are refused at load.

To reference **existing** geometry (e.g. connect a pipe between two structures),
set `needs_object_pick() -> true`; the host then calls
`on_object_pick(handle, pt)` with the clicked entity's handle (read its
XDATA/geometry via `HostApi`). Over `--serve` the pick is supplied as a hex
handle: `run "MY_CMD 2F 30"`.

### XDATA — domain persistence

Store domain data on entities as XDATA (under your `xdata_apps` ids), not in a
side database, so it round-trips through DWG/DXF. `write_record` also registers
the APPID. Document your schemas in the plugin's own `PLUGIN.md`.

---

## Building & distribution

Build per platform and publish to **GitHub Releases**:

```
cargo build --release        # → target/release/lib<crate>.so | <crate>.dll | lib<crate>.dylib
```

A release attaches one binary per platform plus `plugin.toml`, with the platform
in the asset name so the host can pick the right one:

```
opencad.example-linux-x86_64.so
opencad.example-windows-x86_64.dll
opencad.example-macos-aarch64.dylib
plugin.toml
```

A GitHub Actions matrix workflow (see the example repo / template) cross-builds
and uploads these on a `v*` tag. It also fills `plugin.toml`'s `rustc_version`
and `acadrust_source` placeholders from the CI run's actual toolchain and
resolved dependency, rather than hand-editing them per release — see
`docs/plugin-template/.github/workflows/release.yml` for the exact `sed`
substitutions, including reading `acadrust_source` out of `Cargo.lock`'s
resolved `opencadcodec` package entry (`source = "git+...#<hash>"`) since that's
the same value the host embeds at its own build time. The template's CI pins
`rust-toolchain@stable`, which is a floating target — a real release pipeline
should pin the exact toolchain version the host was built with (check
`crates/ocs_plugin_api/src/version_info.rs`'s embedded value, or the host's
own CI config) rather than trusting "whatever's current stable today" to
keep matching it.

---

## Loading

On startup the host scans `<config>/OpenCADStudio/plugins/<id>/` for a
`plugin.toml` + native library (`src/plugin/external.rs`):

```
<config>/OpenCADStudio/plugins/
  opencad.example/
    plugin.toml
    libocs_example_plugin.so      # any name with the platform extension
```

For each compatible package the host spawns **itself** in runner mode
(`--ocs-plugin-runner <socket> <cdylib>`). The child process loads the `cdylib`
in its own address space and connects back to the host over an `interprocess`
local socket. The runner checks `ocs_plugin_api_version` and refuses on
mismatch, then calls `ocs_plugin_register` to obtain the boxed `BuiltinPlugin`.
Each plugin runs in a separate OS process, so a plugin crash or memory
corruption cannot affect the host or other plugins. Plugin processes stay
**resident for the session**; external plugins merge into the same ribbon and
`try_dispatch` path the host uses and honour the enable/disable set
(`disabled_plugins` in `settings.txt`).

Two timeouts protect the host from a stuck runner:

| Timeout | Env var | Default | Floor |
|---|---|---|---|
| Spawn (connection) | `OCS_PLUGIN_SPAWN_TIMEOUT_SECS` | 30 s | — |
| Per-call | `OCS_PLUGIN_CALL_TIMEOUT_SECS` | 30 s | `GetManifest`/`GetRibbon` ≥ 5 s, `Dispatch` ≥ 10 s, interactive events/prompt/pick ≥ 2 s |

A call timeout covers the full round-trip, including any nested plugin→host
requests handled inline. When it fires the host kills the runner, marks the
plugin dead, and reports a `CallTimeout` error via the normal plugin error path.

`<config>` is `%APPDATA%` (Windows), `~/Library/Application Support` (macOS), or
`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` / `~/.config` (Linux).

## Failure handling

| Failure | Behavior |
|---|---|
| Plugin panics | Caught inside the plugin runner child; an error response is returned to the host and stays alive. |
| Plugin crash / hang / malformed message | The host detects a dead process via `try_wait` on the next dispatch or ribbon rebuild; the tab is dropped and an error is logged. |
| Slow or non-responsive call | The per-call timeout (`OCS_PLUGIN_CALL_TIMEOUT_SECS`) fires, kills the runner, and surfaces a `CallTimeout` error. |
| Spawn failure | Reported per-plugin during startup and surfaced in the Plugin Manager / command line. |
| Oversized message | The length-framed transport rejects messages larger than 64 MiB. |

---

## Marketplace

The desktop **Plugin Manager** (`PLUGINS` / `PLUGINMANAGER`, or the Start-page
button) installs plugins from GitHub Releases. In the browser, the same entry
points show a desktop-download notice because marketplace packages are native
dynamic libraries:

- **Curated registry** — [`plugins/registry.json`](../plugins/registry.json) in
  this repo lists discoverable plugins. The host fetches it from `main` at
  runtime and shows each entry under *Available plugins*. To list a plugin, open
  a PR adding `{ "repo", "name", "description" }` (see
  [`plugins/README.md`](../plugins/README.md)); merged PRs reach every user with
  no app update.
- **Manual link** — *Add a repository* (`owner/repo`) for unlisted or private
  dev repos; linked repos persist in `settings.json`.
- **Install / upgrade / reinstall** — pick a release from the dropdown and
  *Install*; the host downloads the platform asset + `plugin.toml` into the
  plugins folder, checking `api_version` first. Reinstalling overwrites and
  clears any stale library; picking a newer release upgrades. Changes take effect
  on the next restart (the running library stays resident).
- **Uninstall** — removes the package folder (effective next restart).
- **Enable/disable** — toggles a loaded plugin's ribbon tab + dispatch without
  uninstalling.

One linked repository is one marketplace entry. Publish separate plugins from
separate repositories so release and update histories stay unambiguous.

---

## Compatibility & ABI

Plugins are loaded as `cdylib`s by a plugin-runner child process. The host spawns
this child from its own executable (`--ocs-plugin-runner` mode), so the runner
and host always share the same `ocs_plugin_api` build. The runner checks
`ocs_plugin_api_version` before any plugin code runs. Each plugin runs in its
own OS process, so a plugin crash or memory-corruption bug cannot take down the
host process itself. The runner loads the plugin library in-process, however,
so API v4+ requires matching `rustc_version` and `acadrust_source` metadata.

A future hardening step is a `#[repr(C)]` vtable (a true C ABI) so binaries built
by any toolchain interoperate — required before trusting prebuilt binaries from
arbitrary build environments.

---

## Roadmap

Done:

- [x] Stable `ocs_plugin_api` crate — dependency-free core + `host` feature
      (`HostApi` / `BuiltinPlugin` / `export_plugin!`).
- [x] Runtime discovery + out-of-process loading (host spawns itself in runner
      mode) with an `api_version` gate and `interprocess` local-socket IPC.
- [x] XDATA helpers, `ModuleEvent::PluginFileDialog`, per-tab plugin state.
- [x] Marketplace — curated registry + manual repo link, install / upgrade /
      reinstall / uninstall, enable/disable.
- [x] Interactive command round-trip over IPC (prompt, point/enter/object-pick).
- [x] Spawn and per-call IPC timeouts so a stuck runner cannot freeze the host.
- [x] External automation (`--mcp` — local stdio MCP/JSON-RPC server for AI
      clients; `--serve` — headless JSON automation server; both drive OCS
      from a separate process without the GUI, per `src/cli.rs`/`src/mcp.rs`/
      `app::serve`). This closes the "drive OCS headless from a process" goal
      of issue #29; this line previously and incorrectly listed it as not yet
      started.

Next:

- [ ] Incremental document snapshots instead of cloning `CadDocument` over IPC.
- [ ] `#[repr(C)]` vtable / strict handshake for cross-toolchain binaries.
- [ ] Trust: checksums / signatures before spawning plugin processes.
- [ ] Interchange (LandXML / SWMM) and live `on_entity_committed` hooks.

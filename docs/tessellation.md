# Entity tessellation paths

How each opencadcodec `EntityType` becomes drawable geometry in OpenCADStudio.

There are **three ways** an entity gets there, and they must not be conflated:

1. **Kernel B-rep mesh** — the ACIS document is lifted into a opencadkernel `Body`
   and each face triangulated in its own surface's parameter space. The only
   path that produces filled *mesh* triangles from analytic surfaces.
2. **Curve-sampled** — the entity's geometry is read through
   `entities::curve::entity_curve`, which is where each type's curve is defined
   once, and tessellated to a chord tolerance. Output is a polyline; no surface
   is involved.
3. **Direct** — points, segments or triangles emitted straight from the
   entity's own fields.

The distinction between (2) and (3) is worth keeping because (2) is a single
definition shared with everything else that needs an entity's geometry — snap
candidates, EXTRUDE and REVOLVE profiles, hatch boundaries, clip outlines. A
circle drawn on screen and a circle handed to the Model tab come from the same
place and cannot disagree.

Entry points: `src/scene/convert/tess.rs` (`tessellate_entity`, the per-entity
dispatcher) → `src/scene/convert/tessellate.rs` (`tessellate`, the
`RenderObject` router), `src/entities/curve.rs` (curve definitions and
sampling) and `src/scene/convert/curve_tol.rs` (the per-frame chord tolerance).

## Summary

| Path | Entities |
|---|---|
| **Kernel B-rep mesh** (lift → per-face triangulation, with a direct per-surface fallback) | `Solid3D`, `Region`, `Body`, `Surface` |
| **Curve-sampled** (`entity_curve` → chord-tolerance tessellation) | `Line`, `Arc`, `Circle`, `Ellipse`, `Spline`, `LwPolyline`, `Polyline`, `Polyline2D`, `Polyline3D` — *non-thick variants only* |
| **Direct** (segments/triangles emitted straight) | everything else |

> The Model/Design-tab primitives (BOX, SPHERE, CYLINDER, CONE, WEDGE, TORUS,
> PYRAMID, EXTRUDE, REVOLVE) are true kernel B-reps too, cached on the Scene as
> `Body` and meshed the same way — but they are created as `Solid3D`
> placeholders carrying that body, not as their own `EntityType`. SWEEP and
> LOFT produce a mesh only, with no B-rep behind it.

ACIS solids dispatch through `solid3d_tess::tessellate_acis`, which lifts the
document into the kernel first (`acis_kernel::tessellate_sat`) and falls back
to a bespoke per-surface LOD sampler (`tessellate_sat_lods`) when the kernel
cannot express a face — so their path is **kernel-with-direct-fallback**. The
fallback is not silent: a mesh whose faces did not all lift is marked
incomplete, because one missing wall looks exactly like a finished solid.

Curved-surface tessellation density is radius-relative (`CURVE_REL_TOL`, a
fraction of the surface radius) so a cylinder's facet count matches the
circle/arc wire tessellation instead of exploding on large radii.

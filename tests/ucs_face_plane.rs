//! `UCS FACE` turns a pick on a solid into a drawing plane. The plane is only
//! as good as the face lookup underneath it, so this covers that half: given a
//! body and a point on one of its faces, does the right face come back, and is
//! its outward normal the one a sketch should be built on?
//!
//! The axis construction on top of that normal is unit-tested beside
//! `ucs_from_normal` in `src/app/helpers.rs`, which is `pub(crate)` and so out
//! of reach from here.
